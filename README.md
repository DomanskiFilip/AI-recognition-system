A machine learning project for classifying aerial objects into three categories: **Birds**, **Drones**, and **Aeroplanes** using image data from Kaggle.

## Overview

This project processes and prepares aerial imagery data for classification tasks. It downloads datasets from Kaggle, processes images, and prepares them for machine learning model training to distinguish between birds, drones, and airplanes.

## Features

-  Automated Kaggle dataset downloading
-  Image preprocessing and normalization
-  Standardized image resizing
-  Data visualization capabilities

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Colab account (or Jupyter Notebook environment)
- Kaggle account with API credentials

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Kaggle API Credentials

1. Go to [kaggle.com/settings](https://www.kaggle.com/settings)
2. Scroll to **API** section
3. Click **Create New API Token**
4. Download `kaggle.json` (contains your username and key)

### 2. Configure Credentials in Google Colab

1. Open your notebook in Google Colab
2. Click the 🔑 **Secrets** icon in the left sidebar
3. Add two secrets:
   - **Name:** `KAGGLE_USERNAME` | **Value:** Your Kaggle username
   - **Name:** `KAGGLE_KEY` | **Value:** Your Kaggle API key
4. Toggle notebook access ON for both secrets

### 3. Run the Notebook

Execute the cells in order to:
- Configure Kaggle authentication
- Download datasets
- Process images
- Visualize samples

## Dataset

This project uses datasets from Kaggle:

 **Drone Detection Dataset**
   - Source: `maryamlsgumel/drone-detection-dataset`
   - Categories: Birds, Drones, Aeroplanes
   - Authors: Maryam Lawan salisu, Aminu Musa

### Label Mapping

```python
{
  'Birds': 1,
  'Drones': 2,
  'Aeroplanes': 3
}
```
